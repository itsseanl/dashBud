# dashBud
a simple windows phone 8.1 dashcam application that records and saves up to 5 video clips with date/time and speed overlays. Options included for switching between mph/kph and setting video clip length to either 5 or 10 minutes.

dashBud is a current work in progress. There are some issues with limiting the video saves to five clips, and speed is not reading accurately. I’ve been unable to pinpoint the reason for the latter issue, and at the moment my windows machine is out of commission, so I haven’t had an opportunity to continue work on it. Hopefully that will change soon!
